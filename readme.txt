This is an openGL Demo project using Qt as display window.
Purspose of this project is to learn and get experties into openGl APIs.
At the moment we are not concern about Qt UI but in later stage of project 
it will have nice attractive UI and more user friendly Demo along with 
implementation of smart widgets like QStackWidget, more compact design(design patterns),
touch events(for smartphones or any touch device), mouse events, keyboard events more inteligently.

currently it compiles for Windows but can be cross compiled for MAC, linux
and any other real time operating system.

Requirement(Windows):
(1) Install Qt SDK and QtCreator
(2) open project "opengltest.pro" on QtCreartor.
(3) Build and Run.

If any problem in compilation please contact 
at email:panpaliamahen@gmail.com.
